## 🎯 Images to Convert

### Priority Order (by file size)

| Priority | Current File | New Filename | Current Size | Target Size | Location |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| 🔴 HIGH | `team-of-skydivers-working.png` | `team-air-coach-paracadutismo.webp` | 1.4MB | < 200KB | `public/` |
| 🟠 MEDIUM | `smartphone-air-coach2.jpg` | `app-air-coach-smartphone-demo.webp` | 475KB | < 150KB | `public/` |
| 🟠 MEDIUM | `smartphone-air-coach.jpg` | `app-air-coach-smartphone-interfaccia.webp` | 439KB | < 150KB | `public/` |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | `parachutist-in-flight-with-open-blue-sky-and-cloud2.jpg` | `paracadutista-volo-cielo-aperto-hero.webp` | 225KB | < 150KB | `public/` |
| 🟢 LOW | `air-coach-logo-full.jpg` | `logo-air-coach-full.webp` | 57KB | < 50KB | `public/` |

**Note:** `favicon.svg` (148KB) should remain as SVG since it's a vector format and already optimal.

### Method 2: cwebp CLI (Recommended for Batch Conversion)

**cwebp** is Google's official WebP encoder for command-line use.

**Windows:**
Download from [Google's WebP downloads page](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download)

#### Usage

Navigate to the `public/` directory:

```bash
cd public/
```

**Convert individual images:**

```bash
# Team image (highest priority)
cwebp -q 80 team-of-skydivers-working.png -o team-air-coach-paracadutismo.webp

# Smartphone images
cwebp -q 82 smartphone-air-coach.jpg -o app-air-coach-smartphone-interfaccia.webp
cwebp -q 82 smartphone-air-coach2.jpg -o app-air-coach-smartphone-demo.webp

# Hero image
cwebp -q 85 parachutist-in-flight-with-open-blue-sky-and-cloud2.jpg -o paracadutista-volo-cielo-aperto-hero.webp

# Logo

```

**Batch conversion script:**

Create a file named `convert-to-webp.sh`:

#!/bin/bash

# Team image
cwebp -q 80 team-of-skydivers-working.png -o team-air-coach-paracadutismo.webp

# Smartphone images
cwebp -q 82 smartphone-air-coach.jpg -o app-air-coach-smartphone-interfaccia.webp

## 📊 Validation

After conversion, verify the optimization:

### 1. Check File Sizes

```bash
cd public/
ls -lh *.webp
```

Expected results:
- `team-air-coach-paracadutismo.webp`: < 200KB
- `app-air-coach-smartphone-interfaccia.webp`: < 150KB
- `app-air-coach-smartphone-demo.webp`: < 150KB
- `paracadutista-volo-cielo-aperto-hero.webp`: < 150KB
- `logo-air-coach-full.webp`: < 50KB

### 2. Test Local Build

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify all images load correctly.

### 3. Test PageSpeed Insights

After deploying to production:
1. Visit [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
2. Enter your site URL: `https://website-air-coach.pages.dev`
3. Check the "Largest Contentful Paint" (LCP) metric
4. Verify "Properly size images" passes

**Target Metrics:**
- Total image size: < 1MB (currently ~2.8MB)
- LCP: < 2.5s
- All images should show green in PageSpeed

## 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)

After confirming WebP images work correctly, you can remove the old image files:

```bash
cd public/
rm team-of-skydivers-working.png
rm smartphone-air-coach.jpg
rm smartphone-air-coach2.jpg
rm parachutist-in-flight-with-open-blue-sky-and-cloud2.jpg
rm air-coach-logo-full.jpg

# Also remove unused images
rm parachutist-in-flight-with-open-blue-sky-and-cloud.jpg
rm air-coach-logo-small.jpg
```

**⚠️ Important:** Only delete old files AFTER confirming the WebP versions work correctly on production!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Images not displaying after conversion

1. **Check filename spelling** - Ensure exact match with code references
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
3. **Verify file location** - All WebP files should be in `public/` directory
4. **Check build output** - Run `pnpm run build` and look for errors

### Images too large after conversion

1. **Lower quality setting** - Try 75-80 instead of 85
2. **Resize dimensions** - Consider reducing image dimensions if too large
3. **Use lossless compression** - Tools like ImageOptim can help further

### Build fails

1. **Check file permissions** - Ensure files are readable
2. **Validate Next.js Image component** - Check width/height props
3. **Clear .next cache** - Delete `.next/` folder and rebuild
